# Computational Physics

The material here aims at giving you an introduction to several of the most used algorithms in Computational Science. These algorithms cover topics such as advanced numerical integration using Gaussian quadrature, Monte Carlo methods with applications to random processes, Markov chains, integration of multidimensional integrals and applications to problems in statistical physics and quantum mechanics. Other methods which are presented are eigenvalue problems, from the simple Jacobi method to iterative Krylov methods. Popular methods from linear algebra are also discussed. A good fraction of the course is also devoted to solving ordinary differential equations with or without boundary conditions and finally methods for solving partial differential equations. You will also find material on popular Machine Learning algorithms, starting with various linear regression methods and ending with neural networks. The focus for the Machine Learning algorithms is on supervised learning.

The course is project based and through various projects, normally four to five, you will be exposed to fundamental research problems from various fields (Physics, Geophysics, Chemistry, Mathematics, Statistics etc), where, if possible, we aim at reproducing state of the art scientific results. You will learn to develop and structure codes when solving the projects, develop a critical understanding of the strengths and limits of the various numerical methods, become familiar with supercomputing facilities and parallel computing and learn to write scientific projects. 


## Personal Hygiene
All participants attending the laboratory sessions must maintain proper hygiene and health practices, including:
* frequently wash with soap and water or, if soap is unavailable, using hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol;
* Routinely cleaning and sanitizing living spaces and/or workspace;
* Using the bend of the elbow or shoulder to shield a cough or sneeze;
* Refraining from shaking hands;

## Adherence to Signage and Instructions 
Course participants  will (a) look for instructional signs posted by UiO or public health authorities, (b) observe instructions from UiO or public health authorities that are emailed to my “uio.no” account, and (c) follow those instructions.

## Self-Monitoring
Students will self-monitor for flu-like symptoms (for example, cough, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, fever, sore throat or loss of taste or smell). If a student experiences any flu-like symptoms, they will stay home and contact a health care provider to determine what steps should be taken.
## Exposure to COVID-19 
If a student is exposed to someone who is ill or has tested positive for the COVID-19 virus, they will stay home, contact a health care provider and follow all public health recommendations. You may also contact the study administration of the department where you are registered as student. 
## Compliance and reporting 
Those who come to UiO facilities must commit to the personal responsibility necessary for us to remain as safe as possible, including following the specific guidelines outlined in this syllabus and provided by UiO more broadly (see links below here).
