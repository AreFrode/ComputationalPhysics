  * Numerical differentiation and loss of numerical precision (chapter 3 lecture notes)
  * Computer lab: Thursday and Friday. First time: Thursday and Friday this week, Presentation of hardware and software at room FV329 first hour of every labgroup and solution of first simple exercises. The first two weeks we focus on simple programming exercises and to set up github and QTcreator. This week we discuss how to set up git and obtain a github account and look at two simple programming exercises and for those interested start with project 1.

===== Lectures and ComputerLab =====

!bblock
  * Lectures: Thursday (8.15am-10am) and Friday (8.15am-10am), Store Fys Aud.
  * Weekly reading assignments needed to solve projects.
  * First hour of each lab session may be used to discuss technicalities, address questions etc linked with projects.
  * Detailed lecture notes, exercises, all programs presented, projects etc can be found at the homepage of the course.
  * Computerlab: Thursday (10am-6pm, room FV203, Dept of Physics) and Friday (10am-6pm, room FÃ˜434, Dept of Physics). Depending on the number of participants, we may extend to more lab sessions. Please bring your own laptops to the lab sessions.
  * Weekly plans and all other information are on the official webpage.
  * No final exam, the last three projects are graded.  In total five projects which all have to be approved.

===== Course Format =====

!bblock
  * Five compulsory projects. Electronic reports only using "devilry":"https://devilry.ifi.uio.no/" to hand in projects and "Git":"https://github.com/" for repository and all your material.
  * Evaluation and grading: The last three projects are graded and each counts 1/3 of the final mark. No final written or oral exam.
  * C/C++ is the default programming language during lectures, but Fortran2008 and Python are also used. All source codes discussed during the lectures can be found at the webpage and "github address":"https://github.com/CompPhysics/ComputationalPhysics1/tree/master/doc/Programs" of the course. We recommend either C/C++, Fortran2008 or Python as programming languages. You can also try Julia or other languages but at the Lab and during the lectures we will focus on the first languages.

  * This means to teach you structured scientific computing, learn to structure a project.
  * A critical understanding of central mathematical algorithms and methods from numerical analysis. In particular their limits and stability criteria.
  * Always try to find good checks of your codes (like solutions on closed form)
  * To enable you to develop a critical view on the mathematical model and the physics.
