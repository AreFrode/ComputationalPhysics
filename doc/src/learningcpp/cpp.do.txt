TITLE: Teach yourself C++
AUTHOR: Morten Hjorth-Jensen

===== Getting Started, compiling and linking first =====


Assume we have a program file, say _myprogram.cpp_. Note that C++ files have the extension _.cpp_.

Here we discuss how to obtain an executable without using IDEs like "QT":"https://www.qt.io/" creator or other types of integrated development environments ("Visual Studio":"https://www.visualstudio.com/" or other, see "list":"https://sourceforge.net/directory/development/ide/" etc).

The programming language c++ is a so-called "compiled language":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiled_language". 

It means that you need to compile the program (translate the human-like instructions into machine code) and link the resulting compiled file (a so-called _object_ file) with the various libraries in order to obtain an executable file. 

In order to obtain an executable file for a C++ program, the following
instructions under Linux/Unix can be used ("similar instructions apply to the windows-like environments using DOS":"https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms235639.aspx").

First you need to open a terminal on your unix/linux PC/laptop. You need also to have a c++ compiler installed. To check on unix/linux whether a c++ is installed or not type simply (in the terminal window)
!bc sys
which c++
!ec
If you get something like 
!bc 
Mortens-MacBook-Pro:~ hjensen$ which c++
/usr/bin/c++
!ec
you are ok. 
Then compile and link your program as
!bc sys
c++ -c -Wall myprogram.cpp
c++ -o myprogram.exe  myprogram.o
!ec
where the compiler is called through the command c++/g++. The compiler
option -Wall means that a warning is issued in case of non-standard
language. The executable file is in this case _myprogram.exe_. The option
`-c` is for compilation only, where the program is translated into machine code,
while the `-o` option links the produced object file _myprogram.o_
and produces the executable _myprogram.exe_.

You can skip the first step by simply writing
!bc sys
c++ -o myprogram.exe  myprogram.cpp
!ec


Also, to speed up the code use compile options like (compiler flags will be dealt with later)

!bc sys
c++ -O3 -c -Wall myprogram.cpp
!ec


To run your program, simply write 
!bc sys
myprogram.exe
!ec
or if you wish to avoid creating executables which by accident have the same name as operating system commands (with sometime fatal consequences) write
!bc sys
./myprogram.exe
!ec
Here, using . denotes the current directory. Since you want to run a file in your current directory and that directory is not in your $PATH, you need the ./ bit to tell the shell where the executable is.



=== Makefiles and simple scripts ===

Under Linux/Unix it is often convenient to create a
so-called makefile, which is a script which includes possible
compiling commands.  By clicking on the link "here you can see examples of makefiles":"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html". 


If you name your file for _makefile_, simply type the command
_make_ and Linux/Unix executes all possible statements included in your
makefile. 

When you use an IDE like Qt, it creates automatically something similar to a makefile for you and you don't need to hardcode the above statements. 



===== Now, let's get started with the first c++ program  =====


=== "Hello World":"https://github.com/CompPhysics/ComputationalPhysicsMSU/blob/master/doc/Programs/LecturePrograms/programs/IntroProgramming/cpp/hellow.cpp" ===

Here we present the C++ version using _namespace_, see shortly below here for an explanation.
!bc cpppro
// A comment line begins like this in C++ programs
// Standard ANSI-C++ include files
#include <cstdlib> // atof function 
#include <iostream>   // input and output
#include <cmath>      // math functions
using namespace std;
int main (int argc, char* argv[])
{
  // convert the text argv[1] to double using atof:
  double r = atof(argv[1]);  // convert the text argv[1] to double
  double s = sin(r);
  cout << "Hello, World! sin(" << r << ") =" << s << endl;
  return 0;           // success execution of the program 
}
!ec

The compiler must see a declaration of a function before you can
call it (the compiler checks the argument and return types).
The declaration of library functions appears
in so-called ``header files'' that must be included in the program, e.g.,

!bc cppcod
   #include <cstdlib> // atof function 
!ec
We call three functions (atof, sin, cout)
and these are declared in three different header files.

The main program is a function called main
with a return value set to an integer, int (0 if success).
The operating system stores the return value,
and other programs/utilities can check whether
the execution was successful or not.
The command-line arguments are transferred to the main function through

!bc cppcod
   int main (int argc, char* argv[])
!ec

The command-line arguments are transferred to the main function through

!bc cppcod
   int main (int argc, char* argv[])
!ec
The integer `argc` is the no of command-line arguments, set to
one in our case, while
`argv` is a vector of strings containing the command-line arguments
with `argv[0]` containing  the name of the program
and `argv[1]`, `argv[2]`, ... are the command-line args, i.e., the number of
lines of input to the program.
Here we define floating points, see also below,
through the keywords `float` for single precision real numbers and
`double` for double precision. The function
`atof` transforms a text (`argv[1]`) to a float.
The sine function is declared in <cmath>, a library which
is not automatically included and needs to be linked when computing
an executable file. Note that arrays in c++ begin by default with $0$. The first element is here _argv[0]_. 

A one-dimensional array like _argv_ can be defined statically or dynamically. To reserve space in memory statically means defining a variable of this type as
!bc cppcod
char argv[10]; 
!ec
which contains in this case ten elements. Each element has a specific address in memory, see the discussions below on pointers. 


After having compiled this program as 
!bc sys
c++ -o hw.exe hellowd.cpp
!ec
we would run the executable as
!bc sys
Mortens-MacBook-Pro:cpp hjensen$ ./hw.exe 0.5
Hello, World! sin(0.5) =0.479426
!ec

If we do not write the value of $x$ on the commando line we would get
!bc sys
Mortens-MacBook-Pro:cpp hjensen$ ./hw.exe 
Segmentation fault: 11
!ec

In this case, since reading from the command line with a command number of arguments defined the number of elements in the array _argv[]_, trying to access _argv[1]_ results in a segmentation fault. In the last case there is only one command line argument, the name of the executable program. It means that there we only have the array element _argv[0]_. The element _argv[1]_ is not defined and we are trying to access something which is outside the memory slots reserved for _argv[]_. 

We can rewrite our "Hello World without namespace":"https://github.com/CompPhysics/ComputationalPhysicsMSU/blob/master/doc/Programs/LecturePrograms/programs/IntroProgramming/cpp/hellownonamespace.cpp". 

Namespaces provide a method for preventing name conflicts in large projects.
Symbols declared inside a namespace block are placed in a named scope that prevents them from being mistaken for identically-named symbols in other scopes.
Multiple namespace blocks with the same name are allowed. All declarations within those blocks are declared in the named scope.


Here we present the C++ version without using namespace.
!bc cpppro
// A comment line begins like this in C++ programs
// Standard ANSI-C++ include files
#include <cstdlib> // atof function 
#include <iostream>   // input and output
#include <cmath>      // math functions

int main (int argc, char* argv[])
{
  // convert the text argv[1] to double using atof:
  double r = atof(argv[1]);  // convert the text argv[1] to double
  double s = sin(r);
  // Note std::cout and std::endl
  std::cout << "Hello, World! sin(" << r << ") =" << s << std::endl;
  return 0;           // success execution of the program 
}
!ec

I personally tend to use _namespace_ for input and output as I feel it increases the readability of my codes. Thus, all examples from here and on will have a statement like 

!bc cppcod
using namespace std;
!ec





===== Brief summary =====

  * A C/C++ program begins with include statements of header files (libraries,intrinsic functions etc)
  * Functions which are used are normally defined at top (details next week)
  * The main program is set up as an integer, it returns 0 (everything correct) or 1 (something went wrong)
  * Standard `if`, `while` and `for` statements as in Java, Fortran, Python...
  * Integers have a very limited range.
  * A C/C++ array begins by indexing at 0!
  * Array allocations are done by size, not by the final index value.If you allocate an array with 10 elements, you should index them from $0,1,\dots, 9$.
  * Initialize always an array before a computation.



=== From decimal to binary representation ===
Let us now write a program which translates an integer in the decimal representation to one in the binary representation. The mathematical formula for this is given by
!bt
\[
  a_n2^n+a_{n-1}2^{n-1}  +a_{n-2}2^{n-2}  +\dots +a_{0}2^{0}.
\]
!et

In binary notation we have thus $(417)_{10} =(110110001)_2$
since we have

!bt
\begin{align*}
(110100001)_2
&=1\times2^8+1\times 2^{7}+0\times 2^{6}+1\times 2^{5}+0\times 2^{4}+0\times 2^{3}\\
&+0\times 2^{2}+0\times 2^{2}+0\times 2^{1}+1\times 2^{0}.
\end{align*}
!et
To see this, we have performed the following divisions by 2

|-----------------------------------------------------------|
|            |             |                                |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| 417/2=208  | remainder 1 | coefficient of $2^{0}$ is 1    |
| 208/2=104  | remainder 0 | coefficient of $2^{1}$ is 0    |
| 104/2=52   | remainder 0 | coefficient of $2^{2}$ is 0    |
| 52/2=26    | remainder 0 | coefficient of $2^{3}$ is 0    |
| 26/2=13    | remainder 1 | coefficient of $2^{4}$ is 0    |
| 13/2= 6    | remainder 1 | coefficient of $2^{5}$ is 1    |
| 6/2= 3     | remainder 0 | coefficient of $2^{6}$ is 0    |
| 3/2= 1     | remainder 1 | coefficient of $2^{7}$ is 1    |
| 1/2= 0     | remainder 1 | coefficient of $2^{8}$ is 1    |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|


Let us now look at the "code which takes as input from the command line a number in the decimal representation and converts it into the binary representation":"https://github.com/CompPhysics/ComputationalPhysicsMSU/blob/master/doc/Programs/LecturePrograms/programs/IntroProgramming/cpp/program2.cpp"

===== Technical Matter in C/C++: Pointers =====


A pointer specifies where a value resides in the computer's memory (like a house number specifies where a particular family resides on a street).

A pointer points to an address not to a data container of any kind!

Simple example declarations:

!bc cppcod
  using namespace std; // note use of namespace
  int main()
 {
   // what are the differences?
   int var;
   cin >> var;
   int *p, q;
   int *s, *t;
   int * a new[var];    // dynamic memory allocation
   delete [] a;
}
!ec

  printf("Its value: %d\n", var);
  printf("Value of integer pointer p : %p\n",p);
  printf("The value p points at :  %d\n",*p);
  printf("Address of the pointer p : %p\n",&p);
  return 0;

===== "Example codes in c++, transfer of data using call by value and call by reference":"https://github.com/CompPhysics/ComputationalPhysicsMSU/blob/master/doc/Programs/LecturePrograms/programs/Classes/cpp/program6.cpp" =====

    b[i] = i;

void func( int x, int *y) 
{
  // a becomes locally x  and it can be changed locally
  x+=7;
  //  func gets the address of the first element of y (b)

  // control to main  this means that b[0] and b[6] are changed.  
  return;
} // End: function func()

!ec




===== Call by value or reference =====
C++ allows the programmer to use solely call by reference (note that call by reference is implemented as pointers). To see the difference between C and C++, consider the following simple examples.
In C we would write

!bc cppcod
   int n; n =8;
   func(&n); /* &n is a pointer to n */
   ....
   void func(int *i)
   {
     *i = 10; /* n is changed to 10 */
     ....
   }
!ec
whereas in C++ we would write
!bc cppcod
   int n; n =8;
   func(n); // just transfer n itself
   ....
   void func(int& i)
   {
     i = 10; // n is changed to 10
     ....
   }
!ec


The reason why we emphasize the difference between call by value and call
by reference is that it allows the programmer to avoid pitfalls
like unwanted changes of variables. However, many people feel that this
reduces the readability of the code.




===== File handling; C-way =====

!bc cppcod
using namespace std;
#include <iostream>
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
  FILE *in_file, *out_file;
  if( argc < 3)  {
    printf("The programs has the following structure :\n");
    printf("write in the name of the input and output files \n");
    exit(0);
  }
  in_file = fopen( argv[1], "r");// returns pointer to the  input file
  if( in_file == NULL )  { // NULL means that the file is missing
    printf("Can't find the input file %s\n", argv[1]);
    exit(0);
  }
 out_file = fopen( argv[2], "w"); // returns a pointer to the output file
 if( out_file == NULL )  {       // can't find the file
    printf("Can't find the output file%s\n", argv[2]);
    exit(0);
  }

  fclose(out_file);
