    "  * The computer lab (room FV329)consists of 16 Linux PCs, but many prefer own laptops. C/C++ is the default programming language, but Fortran2008 and Python are also used. All source codes discussed during the lectures can be found at the webpage and [github address](https://github.com/CompPhysics/ComputationalPhysics1/tree/master/doc/Programs) of the course. We recommend either C/C++, Fortran2008 or Python as languages.\n",
